# Egyptian Arabic Letters Frequency

I was working on a project & I needed to know the Letters Frequencies for the Egyptian Arabic so I wrote a script to scan the most popular Egyptians websites to figure it out and I am publishing it as an open source statistic and it's open for modifications.
It's not a Scientific Statistical I am just amateur who was facing a problem and I improvised.
